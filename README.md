# FirstProject
URL music convert
Main concept:
Using Java to create a program that accepts links, which will then be taken to a youtube-to-mp3 converter and finally download the mp3 to a database. This will be so I can access the mp3 downloads and then manually place them in a usb for mom :)

I will have to connect this Java file to Javascript, HTML, and maybe CSS

This is still super early in my first project, but will hopefully finish by the end of 2024- August
